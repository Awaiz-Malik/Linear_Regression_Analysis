# Linear_Regression_Analysis using Y = MX + C
## Introduction
- In the Project we will be using five Dataset files **.csv** with the help of **Modular Programming**
  - Pakistan Population
  - Japan Life Expectancy
  - Pakistan Unemployment
  - Price vs Area
  - Salary vs Experience
- We will be using the concept of **Functional Programming** to train Model for each dataset, their **weights** and **bias** will be saved so we can use those values for our Future Testing and Predictions.
- Each header file will be then used in our **winform cpp** along with images illustrations created on **Adobe Illustrator** to create a User Interface for Making Prediction on our trained model.
### Information about the above files
### Project
If you want to Run the project without building files, then access the **Form.exe** and **Graph.exe** to run the project directly
### Regression Analysis 
If you want to Load this project to your system, we will be talking about how to load it on **Visual Studio**
- Install .Net Framework 4.7 or higher, Visual Studio 2019 or higher
- You can visit to this website for further and small detail of how to setup winform c++ project [Setup Winform in Visual Studio for c++](https://www.rkaiser.de/c-winforms-tutorial/) or [visit this video turtorial for furthur details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcxlYkU8aY0&list=PL2i17lRog5pBe7t9zJdFdugQ6bxgjntJD)
- Your main cpp should be the same as this [Mainform.cpp](Regression Analysis/MainForm.cpp)

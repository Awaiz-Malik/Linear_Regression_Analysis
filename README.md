# Linear_Regression_Analysis using Y = MX + C
## Introduction
- In the Project we will be using five Dataset files **.csv** with the help of **Modular Programming**
  - Pakistan Population
  - Japan Life Expectancy
  - Pakistan Unemployment
  - Price vs Area
  - Salary vs Experience
- We will be using the concept of **Functional Programming** to train Model for each dataset, their **weights** and **bias** will be saved so we can use those values for our Future Testing and Predictions.
- Each header file will be then used in our **winform cpp** along with images illustrations created on **Adobe Illustrator** to create a User Interface for Making Prediction on our trained model.
### Information about the above files

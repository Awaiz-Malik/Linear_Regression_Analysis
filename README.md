- In the Project we will be using five Dataset files **.csv** with the help of **Modular Programming**, we will apply Linear Regression on each of them.
  - Pakistan Population
  - Japan Life Expectancy
  - Pakistan Unemployment
  - Price vs Area
  - Salary vs Experience
- We will be using the concept of **Functional Programming** to train Model for each dataset, their **weights** and **bias** will be saved so we can reuse trained model for our Future Testing and Predictions.
- Each header file will be then used in our **winform cpp** along with images illustrations created on **Adobe Illustrator** to create a User Interface for Making Prediction on our trained model.
- In the end we will visualise the training of dataset on graph
### Information about the above files
### Project
If you want to Run the project without building files, then access the **Form.exe** and **Graph.exe** to run the project directly
### Regression Analysis 
If you want to Load this project to your system, we will be talking about how to load it on **Visual Studio**
- Install .Net Framework 4.7 or higher, Visual Studio 2019 or higher
- You can visit to this website for further and small detail of how to setup winform c++ project [Setup Winform in Visual Studio for c++](https://www.rkaiser.de/c-winforms-tutorial/) or [visit this video turtorial for furthur details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcxlYkU8aY0&list=PL2i17lRog5pBe7t9zJdFdugQ6bxgjntJD)
- Your main cpp should be the same as this [Mainform.cpp](https://github.com/Awaiz-Malik/Linear_Regression_Analysis/blob/main/Regression%20Analysis/MainForm.cpp)
- You can use the pngs provided at **PNGS** folder or create your own images :)
- You can check out this blog incase you want to learn [How to Implement Linear Regression in Pytorch](https://www.freecodecamp.org/urdu/news/linear-regression-pytorch-urdu-1-3/)
- After adding those files build the project and Enjoy!!!
### Graph
If you want to visualize the Graphical Analysis
- Download [Matplot++](https://alandefreitas.github.io/matplotplusplus/) use it via cmake or vcpkg in your project, also download [GNUPLOT](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/gnuplot/) and add to enviornment variable to view graphs.
- Run the Graph.cpp which will show the graph for desire dataset you want to see.
